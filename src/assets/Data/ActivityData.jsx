      "We typically think yoga is a physical practice that involves various poses and breathing techniques. Did you know that the mindful repetition of a word or sound is also a type of yoga? The chanting of sacred sound vibrations is known as mantra yoga, japa, or mantra meditation. This ancient practice is one of the most powerful ways to clear your mind, focus your concentration and calm your emotions. This type of yoga is a simple yet potent practice that can be easily learned and only requires a minimum of 15 minutes a day to practice.",

      "What Hatha yoga is hasn’t changed for thousands of years. However our thinking and perception of it certainly has. Language is a powerful thing, and in different cultures the same word can have a variety of definitions. Throughout the evolution of yoga practice, the same word – Hatha – has come to mean different things too.Popular thinking ‘in the West’ (an all-too-common expression now), is that Hatha yoga is about balancing the body and mind. ‘Ha’ represents the esoteric sun, and ‘tha’ the moon. The practice of Hatha yoga aims to join, yoke, or balance these two energies. ",

    description:
      "Kriya Yoga is an ancient meditation technique that is also part of a comprehensive spiritual path. It is an effective technique that works directly with the source of growth — the spiritual energy deep in our spines. The Kriya technique is much more direct. It helps the practitioner to control the life force by mentally drawing it up and down the spine, with awareness and will. According to Yogananda, one Kriya, which takes about a half-minute, is equivalent to one year of natural spiritual growth.",

    name: "Bhakti Yoga",
    description:
      "What keeps us from realising our true nature? Bhakti yoga explains that the main issue is that we have disassociated from the sacredness and divinity that encompasses and comprises everything in the Universe, including ourselves. Because of this, we often see ourselves as a separate part of a very mundane world. Bhakti yoga is a practice of selfless devotion and recognition of the sacred or divine in everything. To encourage Bhakti, it is helpful to start by cultivating reverence to something which appears to be separate from one’s self through acknowledgment of the sacred essence within it. ",

    name: "Raj Yoga",
    description:
      "In Sanskrit, the word raja translates as king, chief, or royal. Thus, raja yoga is considered to be the best path to attaining the highest state of yoga—samadhi or enlightenment. It refers to both the highest goal of yoga and the meditation practices used to attain this goal. Swami Vivekananda describes this internal meditative practice as a path towards mastering the whole universe. He writes, “Raja-Yoga proposes to start from the internal world, to study internal nature, and through that, control the whole—both internal and external.",

    description:
      "The jñāna yoga is a spiritual practice that pursues knowledge with questions such as 'who am I, what am I' among others. The practitioner studies usually with the aid of a guru, meditates, reflects, and reaches liberating insights on the nature of one's own Self (Atman, soul) and its relationship to the metaphysical concept called Brahman in Hinduism. The jñāna-mārga ideas are discussed in ancient and medieval era Hindu scriptures and texts such as the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita.",
